## EAF â†’ TXT

With this tool, one can generate plaintext lists (.txt) of annotations contained in ELAN files (.eaf).

The output files will contain, in order: *Tier*, *Participant*, *Start Time*, *End Time*, *Total Time*, and *Annotation Value*.

## To run:
Double-click 'app.R' to open it (RStudio should launch automatically), and type into the R Console: 'shiny::runApp()'

Here's a demonstration:

## Output format:
The basename of uploaded files will be preserved, and the output will be downloaded into the same directory.

As an example, if you upload a.eaf and b.eaf from your Desktop:
- /Desktop/a.eaf
- /Desktop/b.eaf

then the final output will be two files, a.txt and b.txt, on your Desktop as well:
- /Desktop/a.txt
- /Desktop/b.txt

and your Desktop will contain all four files.

## Troubleshooting:
- If you receive the error "App dir must contain either app.R or server.R" in RStudio, *click*: Session > Set Working Directory > To Source File Location
- If you receive the error "Unable to locate package NAME", *type in Console*: install.packages("NAME"), replacing NAME with the package name
